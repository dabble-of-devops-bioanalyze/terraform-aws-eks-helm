## QuickStart

This is a cookicutter template to create Terraform modules based on the [BioAnalyze](https://www.bioanalyze.io) terraform recipe examples.

```{note}
Using the BioAnalyze project templates assumes some familiarity with using a terminal, configuration formats, and Makefiles.
```

Run the cookiecutter command to generate a project template.

Your project name is a concatenation of `["namespace", "environment", "stage", "name", "attributes"]` with `-` between. You can leave any of them out.

For example:

```json
{
    "namespace" : "bioanalyze",
    "environment" : "eks",
    "stage" : "dev"
}
```

Results in the project name: `bioanalyze-eks-dev`.

```{note}
Before deploying your resources I *highly* recommend that you think about how you would like to name your resources. Choose a naming convention that makes sense for you.

Often I see projects the `namespace` based on lab, project, or analysis, `environment` as the AWS Infrastructure type such as Batch, SLURM, or Kubernetes, and stage as the usual `dev`, `stage`, `prod`.

Examples:

| namespace | stage | environment |
| :----------  | :---------- | :---------- |
| lab-a     | dev, stage, prod | fargate-batch, ec2-batch, eks, slurm |
| analysis-b     | dev, stage, prod | fargate-batch, ec2-batch, eks, slurm |

### Run with the default settings

The simplest way to run cookiecutter is by using the default CLI and running through the prompts.

```
cookiecutter \
	{{cookiecutter.docs_data.github_repo}} \
	--directory {{cookiecutter.docs_data.directory}}
```

### Supply variables from a configuration file

Some recipes have a lot of variables, and you may not be ready to decide them all in one go.

If that is the case create a `config.json` file and feed that to cookiecutter. At a minimum you need to include your project name. For more information on naming schemas see. {ref}`terraform-module-naming-convention`

```json
{
    "namespace" : "bioanalyze",
    "environment" : "eks",
    "stage" : "dev"
}
```

#### From the CLI

Run cookiecutter with your supplied config and use the suppress user input options.

```bash
cookiecutter \
	{{cookiecutter.docs_data.github_repo}} \
	--directory {{cookiecutter.docs_data.directory}} \
    --config-file path-to-config.json \
    --no-input
```

#### From a Python Console

Or from a python script or console:

```python
from cookiecutter.main import cookiecutter

cookiecutter({{cookiecutter.docs_data.github_repo}},
        directory={{cookiecutter.docs_data.directory}},
        no_input=True,
        # add your own namespace/environment/stage here
        extra_context= {
            "namespace" : "bioanalyze",
            "environment" : "eks",
            "stage" : "dev"
        })
```

## Customizing your Deployment with Terraform Variables

From here take a look at the `terraform.example.tfvars` and the `terraform.example.tfvars.json` file.

Each of these files serves the same purpose, to add variables to our deployment. Pick one of these files and rename it remove the `.example` from the name.

```bash
cp terraform.example.tfvars terraform.tfvars.json
```

Or:

```bash
cp terraform.example.tfvars terraform.tfvars.json
```

```{warning}
Make sure to use only one file, either the `tfvars` or the `tfvars.json`. Using both will make the computer lose it's mind.
```

```{note}
This quickstart is shared among many modules. For individual tips and tricks please see the documentation for that module.
```

## Deploy your Infrastructure

In any BioAnalyze project the `Makefile` is always the source of truth and light.

```bash
make help
# Initialize the terraform module. This does some sanity checks and downloads any needed external modules.
make terraform/init
# Planning will tell you what resources will be created/destroyed
make terraform/plan
make terraform/apply
# If you're sure you can run the auto-approve
#make terraform/apply/autoapprove
```

## Save, Share and Reproduce your Infrastructure

We use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to deploy our resources in large part because it saves and backs up the state, which is mostly whether or not we have created our resources. By default running `terraform apply` will save your state to a `terraform.tfstate` file. You should not share this file publically or commit to a public github repo.

It is recommended to save your terraform state to a [remote backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/remote.html). A single remote backend can house multiple deployments.

I recommend using the [Cloudposse Remote S3 Backend](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend).

```bash
mkdir -p terraform-remote-backend
cd terraform-remote-backend
touch main.tf
```

Grab this code and add it to your `main.tf` file.

```terraform
# main.tf
module "terraform_state_backend" {
   source = "cloudposse/tfstate-backend/aws"
   # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
   # version     = "x.x.x"
   namespace  = "YOUR_NAMESPACE"
   stage      = "YOUR_STAGE"
   name       = "terraform"
   attributes = ["state"]

   terraform_backend_config_file_path = "."
   terraform_backend_config_file_name = "backend.tf"
   force_destroy                      = false
}
```

If you have terraform installed locally you can run:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
terraform init -force-copy
```

You can also grab the `Makefile` here and run:

```bash
# Initialize the terraform module. This does some sanity checks and downloads any needed external modules.
make terraform/init
# Planning will tell you what resources will be created/destroyed
make terraform/plan
# If you're sure you can run the auto-approve
make terraform/apply/autoapprove
make terraform/init/force-copy
```

You will now see a `backend.tf` file with your backend configuration. The configuration for the remote backend state is also saved in the `key`: `terraform.tfstate`

```
# backend.tf
 backend "s3" {
   region         = "us-east-1"
   bucket         = "< the name of the S3 state bucket >"
   key            = "terraform.tfstate"
   dynamodb_table = "< the name of the DynamoDB locking table >"
   profile        = ""
   role_arn       = ""
   encrypt        = true
 }
```

In order to use this backend in another project copy the generated `backend.tf` file in your `terraform-remote-backend` directory, but change `key`.

Most often I use the backend `key` to house the `environment` tag.

| namespace | stage | environment |
| :----------  | :---------- | :---------- |
| bioanalyze     | test | ec2-batch |

```terraform
# Example terraform state for:
# namespace=bioanalyze
# stage=test
# environment=ec2-batch

# backend.tf
 terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.12.2"

  backend "s3" {
    region         = "us-east-1"
    bucket         = "bioanalyze-test-terraform-state"
    key            = "ec2-batch"
    dynamodb_table = "bioanalyze-test-terraform-state-lock"
    profile        = ""
    role_arn       = ""
    encrypt        = "true"
  }
}

```

## Terraform Module Naming Convention

Before you start creating multiple projects it's recommended that you document your naming convention.

We use the [CloudPosse](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-example-module) as a base, and the [Label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label) module to generate a name.

The name is generated as:

```
delimiter = '{{cookiecutter.delimiter}}'

label_order         = ["namespace", "environment", "stage", "name", "attributes"]
id_context = {
    "namespace" : "{{ cookiecutter.namespace}}",
    "tenant" : "{{cookiecutter.tenant}}",
    "name" : "{{ cookiecutter.name}}",
    "environment" : "{{cookiecutter.environment}}",
    "stage"       : "{{cookiecutter.stage}}",
    "name"       : "{{cookiecutter.name}}"
}

labels = []
for l in label_order:
    if l in id_context and l:
        labels.append(id_context[l])

id_full = delimiter.join(labels)

{{ cookiecutter.update({ "project_name": id_full }) }}
```

You do not need to include all the labels. Usually I only use namespace, environment, and stage.

```
namespace = "bioanalyze"
environment = "eks"
stage = "dev"
```

Would result in the project name `bioanalyze-eks-dev`.

Here is an example directory structure.

```bash
└── bioanalyze
    ├──ec2-batch
    │   ├── dev
    │   │   ├── backend.tf
    │   │   └── main.tf
    │   ├── prod
    │   │   ├── backend.tf
    │   │   └── main.tf
    ├── fargate-batch
    │   ├── dev
    │   │   ├── backend.tf
    │   │   └── main.tf
    │   ├── prod
    │   │   ├── backend.tf
    │   │   └── main.tf
    ├── eks
    │   ├── dev
    │   │   ├── backend.tf
    │   │   └── main.tf
    │   ├── prod
    │   │   ├── backend.tf
    │   │   └── main.tf
```
## Complex Naming Conventions

Now let's say that you have a lab, that does both cellpainting and single cell. You want to have separate Batch environments for each of these, as well as seperate EKS environments for various data visualization applications. In this scenario I would bring in the `name` variable of the backend.

```bash
└── bioanalyze
    ├── ec2-batch
    │   └── dev
    │       ├── cellpainting
    │       │   ├── backend.tf
    │       │   └── main.tf
    │       └── single-cell
    │           ├── backend.tf
    │           └── main.tf
    └── eks
        └── dev
            ├── dash-bio
            │   ├── backend.tf
            │   └── main.tf
            └── rshiny-omics
                ├── backend.tf
                └── main.tf
```

Or in tabular format:

| namespace | stage | environment | name |
| :----------  | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| bioanalyze   | dev | eks | rshiny-omics |
| bioanalyze   | dev | eks | dash-bio |
| bioanalyze   | dev | fargate-batch | cellpainting |
| bioanalyze   | dev | fargate-batch | single-cell |
| bioanalyze   | prod | eks | rshiny-omics |
| bioanalyze   | prod | eks | dash-bio |
| bioanalyze   | prod | fargate-batch | cellpainting |
| bioanalyze   | prod | fargate-batch | single-cell |


```terraform
# bioanalyze/eks/dev/rshiny-omics/backend.tf
backend "s3" {
    region         = "us-east-1"
    bucket         = "bioanalyze-eks-dev"
    key            = "bioanalyze-eks-dev-rshiny-omics"
    dynamodb_table = "bioanalyze-eks-dev"
    profile        = ""
    role_arn       = ""
    encrypt        = true
}
```

## Terraform Naming Convention Benefits

Using a consistent naming convention will save you from lots of headache and frustration. By default all of [BioAnalyze](https://www.bioanalyze.io) modules and [CloudPosse](https://cloudposse.com/) module will tag your AWS Infrastructure resources using your naming convention. This allows you to track the activity and costs of your AWS resources using a combination of [resource groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/resource-groups.html) and the AWS Billing console.
