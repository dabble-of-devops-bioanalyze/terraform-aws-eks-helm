**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.

### Bug Reports & Feature Requests

Please use the [issue tracker]({{ printf "https://github.com/%s/issues" (ds "config").github_repo}}) to report any bugs or file feature requests.

### Developing

If you are interested in being a contributor and want to get involved in developing this project or help out with other projects, I would love to hear from you! Shoot me an email at jillian@dabbleofdevops.com.

In general, PRs are welcome. We follow the typical "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull Request** so that we can review your changes

#### Developer Notes

The `README.md` is created using the standard [CloudPosse](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-example-module) template that has been modified to use BioAnalyze information and URLs, and other documentation is generated using [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/).

Terraform code does not render properly when using the `literalinclude` directive, so instead we use `pygmentize` to render it to html which is included directly.

```
.. raw:: html
   :file: ./_html/main.tf.html
```

**NOTE:** Be sure to merge the latest changes from "upstream" before making a pull request!
